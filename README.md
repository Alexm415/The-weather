# The-weather

This api challenge was hard to understand and use the Api correctly. It was really great once i understood how to use the api so i can pull the correct data

## User experiance

When the user inputs what city they want to see the weather for. The app than does a fetch call and displays a 5 day weather forcast. It also shows the wind speed and the time and Humidity.

## Credits

The Xpert learning assistant help me see why the code was not working as it should. Office hours help me alot with this work.
